# 🌐 Cyber Webring

Welcome to the Cyber Webring — a decentralized directory of hand-built web pages, crafted by people who like making things the old-fashioned way.

Each member gets one page. One folder. One chance to express themselves.  
No frameworks. No dependencies. Just HTML, CSS, and maybe some JavaScript if you promise not to break the Internet.

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

This is a digital neighborhood. A quiet corner of the internet. A throwback to when websites were personal, slow, and sometimes a little strange.

Each member builds a single page using the raw web:  
`<html>` + `<style>` + `<script>` = ✅  
`npm install` = 🚫

---

## ✋ Rules of the Ring

### ✅ You *can*:
- Use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Add one `index.html` in your own folder
- Include small, purposeful images (profile photos, illustrations, etc.)
- Link to external media (YouTube, Giphy, etc.)
- Get weird, get personal, get creative

### 🚫 You *cannot*:
- Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- Use npm, pnpm, Yarn, or any build system
- Import external JS libraries or CDN scripts
- Upload large media (audio, video, uncompressed 4K PNGs)
- Add multiple pages, blogs, or full portfolios

This is a *one-page-per-human* operation. Keep it focused.

## 🏘 Neighborhoods

These are fun, themed-but-meaningless web spaces. Pick one that speaks to you, or flip a coin.

- `orbit/` – floaty ideas, loosely connected thoughts
- `midnight-lounge/` – late-night experiments and half-finished brilliance
- `window-seat/` – observational, reflective, probably sketching something
- `ctrl-room/` – toggles, switches, knobs, and terminal energy
- `the-attic/` – dusty, personal, nostalgic
- `404-club/` – weird pages that maybe shouldn’t exist but do

Pages live at:
```
neighborhoods/[place]/[number]/
```

## 🖼 Media Guidelines (a.k.a. Don’t Turn This Into Dropbox)

We’re fans of aesthetic flourishes, but let’s keep it lean:

### ✅ Allowed:
- A small image or two (under 500 KB, please)
- SVGs, emoji, ASCII art, or CSS-only chaos
- Embedded media from elsewhere

### 🚫 Not Allowed:
- Audio and video files
- Large high-res screenshots
- Bundles of unused assets
- Pixel art spritesheets of your entire dev career

> **Tip:** Use services like [imgur.com](https://imgur.com), [Giphy](https://giphy.com), or [YouTube](https://youtube.com) if you need to host big stuff.

## 🕹 Bring Back the Web

You remember what the old web felt like: quirky, messy, personal, and full of raw HTML energy.  
Let’s bring that back, one hand-coded page at a time.
