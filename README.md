# 🌐 Cyber Webring

✨ ✨ ✨ https://cyber-webring.netlify.app/ ✨ ✨ ✨

Welcome to the Cyber Webring — a decentralized directory of hand-built web pages, crafted by people who like making things the old-fashioned way.

Each member gets one page. One folder. One chance to express themselves.  
No frameworks. No dependencies. Just HTML, CSS, and maybe some JavaScript if you promise not to break the Internet.

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

This is a digital neighborhood. A quiet corner of the internet. A throwback to when websites were personal, slow, and sometimes a little strange.

Each member builds a single page using the raw web:  
`<html>` + `<style>` + `<script>` = ✅  
`npm install` = 🚫

## ✋ Rules of the Ring

### ✅ You _can_:

- Use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Include small, purposeful images (profile photos, illustrations, etc.)
- Link to external media (YouTube, Giphy, etc.)

### 🚫 You _cannot_:

- Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- Use npm, pnpm, Yarn, or any build system
- Import external JS libraries or CDN scripts
- Upload large media (audio, video, uncompressed 4K PNGs)
- Add multiple pages, blogs, or full portfolios
- Delete the webring navigation at the bottom of your page

This is a _one-page-per-human_ operation. Keep it focused.

## 🏘 Neighborhoods

These are fun, themed-but-meaningless web spaces. Pick one that speaks to you, or flip a coin.

- `404-club/` – For folks who write about code, tooling or other tech-adjacent stuff. (Or
  don't.)
- `cosmic-chaos/` – A place for floating ideas and ephemeral thoughts.
- `the-crypt/` – A place for folks who venture into the dark side of things.
- `rainbow-piazza/` – A bright and playful space where everything sparkles and nothing is subtle.
- `synth-bay/` – A late-night IRC lounge meets low-orbit sci-fi UI, with glow effects.

Pages live at:

```
neighborhoods/[place]/[number]/
```

## 🖼 Media Guidelines (a.k.a. Don’t Turn This Into Dropbox)

We’re fans of aesthetic flourishes, but let’s keep it lean:

### ✅ Allowed:

- A small image or two (under 500 KB, please)
- SVGs, emoji, ASCII art, or CSS-only chaos
- Embedded media from elsewhere

### 🚫 Not Allowed:

- Audio and video files
- Large high-res screenshots
- Bundles of unused assets
- Pixel art spritesheets of your entire life story

> **Tip:** Use services like [imgur.com](https://imgur.com), [Giphy](https://giphy.com), or [YouTube](https://youtube.com) if you need to host big stuff.

You are encouraged to break the mold, just not the rules.

## 🚀 Hosting

This site is built with plain files and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

No builds. No compilers.
