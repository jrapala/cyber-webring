  <h1>Hi, I’m Member-5</h1>
  <p>Senior software engineer. I build tools, platforms, and occasionally useful documentation.</p>

  <p>Currently into:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating dev tools with no dependencies</li>
    <li>Mapping tab order like it’s a subway system</li>
    <li>Fixing things that no one else noticed were broken</li>
    <li>Reading API docs like they’re short stories</li>
    <li>Removing code instead of adding it</li>
    <li>Thinking about how onboarding could be less painful</li>
    <li>Rewatching nature documentaries for the narration</li>
    <li>Building a bathroom with better layout than most design systems</li>
    <li>Keeping chickens alive and reasonably content</li>
    <li>Making maple syrup and occasionally selling it</li>
    <li>Looking for the best pen that isn’t too precious to use</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Not currently into:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frameworks that require 17 config files to render one button</li>
    <li>Design tokens that don’t actually do anything</li>
    <li>Meetings with no notes and no next steps</li>
    <li>Build pipelines that take longer than my coffee break</li>
    <li>CSS-in-JS that forgets the “CSS” part</li>
    <li>Tooling that breaks because you updated one unrelated thing</li>
    <li>“AI-powered” features that just rename your variables</li>
    <li>Form fields that announce themselves but never stop talking</li>
    <li>Weather that ruins chicken coop plans</li>
    <li>Software that needs a restart to remember who you are</li>
  </ul>
