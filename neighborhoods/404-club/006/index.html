    <main>
      <p>Senior software engineer. Tech lead. I build tools, platforms, and occasionally useful documentation.</p>
      <p>I work on platform engineering, design systems and accessibility at The New York Times. I care about developer experience and the little details people usually skip.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I do things completely unrelated to tech like farming and concert production.</p>
      <p>Currently into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixing things that no one else noticed were broken</li>
        <li>Removing code instead of adding it</li>
        <li>Keeping chickens alive and reasonably content</li>
        <li>Maximizing the amount of maple syrup I can produce without losing sleep</li>
        <li>Reading really big novels</li>
        <li>Cutting down trees with my super-cool electric Stihl saw</li>
      </ul>
